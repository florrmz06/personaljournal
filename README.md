Entry 23OCT2023 :
I was able to style the nav bar which i had trouble doing before. I watched a youtube video on creating a nav bar and i was able to see the different css styling code/commands like hover and i also didnt need to create a class or id, and i could just pull specific areas, which wouldnt be ideal in bigger projects but it worked here and it helped me keep organized. I also learned that on a live website i could not display a local photo and had to upload it to a image hosting website to be able to display it.
